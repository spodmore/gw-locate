# GW Locate

**This extension adds a button to the address bar in Firefox (or toolbar in Google Chrome) which allows to view current Google Maps location in the new tab on Wikimapia at the same zoom if available

It works on all supported Google domains except for '.ru'. See the Google domain reference: https://www.google.com/supported_domains.

It doesn't work on websites other than Google Maps (eg. google.com/maps).

Available locales: English (en), Ukrainian (uk).

Tested in
* macOS Sierra: Firefox 55, Google Chrome 60
* Windows 10: Firefox 55, Google Chrome 60

## How it works

On Google Maps website, click the address bar button (or toolbar button in Google Chrome). This will open your location with the same coordinates and zoom (if available) on the wikimapia.org website in the new browser tab.

## Zoom

Direct zoom value is currently not available in the satellite view of Google Maps. In this case Wikimapia will open location with their default zoom.

Zoom might be fractional in Google Maps, it will be rounded on the Wikimapia website.
